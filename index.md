## About Me

I am a 4th-year Ph.D. student at UCLA with Prof. [Cho-Jui Hsieh](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~chohsieh/) and a Student Researcher at Google Research (Ads ML) working on LLMs hosted by Prof. [Inderjit S. Dhillon](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xBv5ZfkAAAAJ&hl=en) (previously [Boqing Gong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lv9ZeVUAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Ting Liu](https://research.google/people/105496/).

My research area is Efficient and Automated Methods for Machine Learning (AIGC, AutoML, Dataset).
I was the recepient of the **[Outstanding Paper Award](https://iclr-conf.medium.com/announcing-iclr-2021-outstanding-paper-awards-9ae0514734ab)** at ICLR 2021.
Besides research, I am also interested in venture capital and entrepreneurial opportunities.

I obtained my B.S. degree (dual) in Computer Science and Statistics from the University of Michigan, with the highest distinction.
During this period, I interned at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/) and [Sensetime](https://www.sensetime.com/en) on machine learning and computer vision, as well as helped a startup to develop its prototype robots.
Prior to that, I worked on quantitative investing at Shanghai Key Laboratory of Finance.


## Research Overview

I study the problem of **AI for AI**.
The goal is to leverage the power of AI agents to automatize the development of itself.
For the past years, I have mainly focused on the following areas:
- **Automated Methods for Language Agents (Current)** <br/>
e.g. [[MoP]()] [[DPO-Diff]()]
- **Dataset Distillation** <br/>
e.g. [[TESLA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10586)] [[DC-BENCH](https://dc-bench.github.io/)] [[FedDM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09653)]
- **AutoML (NAS, OS, HPO)** <br/>
e.g. [[DARTS-PT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.04392)] [[DrNAS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10355)] [[GM-NAS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15207)] [[ENOS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13575)]


## Outreach

- **[VC/Startups]** I've been interviewing for VC positions. If you are in VC/Startup business and for any reason is looking for people with domain knowledge in A.I., I'd be delighted to have a chat with you.
- **[Hiring]** I formed and am leading a Research Colalboration based off several labs to pursue targeted topics in large-scale text-based generative models (LLMs, Diffusion Models). Qualified students will work under direct supervision of Prof. [Cho-Jui Hsieh](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~chohsieh/), Prof. [Tianyi Zhou](https://tianyizhou.github.io/), Prof. [Minhao Cheng](https://cmhcbb.github.io/) and myself, receiving a high degree of freedom and level of attention. For more information on our culture, style and how to apply, please refer to this temporary onboarding [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PtRwK6KuqNhExz_ouiu1UDva5Fw6R7PuvrxsVCzSA9U/edit?usp=sharing).
