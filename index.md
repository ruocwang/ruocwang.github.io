## About Me

I am a 4th-year Ph.D. student at UCLA with Prof. [Cho-Jui Hsieh](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~chohsieh/), and am the founder and current principal of ARC Group - an AIGC Research Collaboration based off 3 labs to pursue targeted topics in Multimodal Language Agents, with the goal of translating them into commercial applications.
I am also serving as a long-term Student Researcher at Google Research (Ads ML) working on advancing the state of LLMs, hosted by Prof. [Inderjit S. Dhillon](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xBv5ZfkAAAAJ&hl=en), [Felix Yu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lYvF6cUAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Si Si](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eAJfUeIAAAAJ&hl=en).

Prior to the era of LLM, I worked on AutoML and Dataset Compression.
I was the recepient of the **[Outstanding Paper Award](https://iclr-conf.medium.com/announcing-iclr-2021-outstanding-paper-awards-9ae0514734ab)** at ICLR 2021.
Besides research, I am also interested in venture capital and entrepreneurial opportunities.

I obtained my B.S. degree (dual) in Computer Science and Statistics from the University of Michigan, with the highest distinction.
During this period, I interned at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/) and [Sensetime](https://www.sensetime.com/en) on machine learning and computer vision, as well as helped a startup to develop its prototype robots.
Prior to that, I worked on quantitative investing at Shanghai Key Laboratory of Finance.


## Research Overview

I study the problem of **AI for AI**.
The goal is to leverage the power of AI agents to automatize the development of itself.
For the past years, I have mainly focused on the following areas:
- **Multimodal Language Agents (Current)** <br/>
e.g. [[MoP]()] [[DPO-Diff]()] [[Mulan]()]
- **Dataset Distillation** <br/>
e.g. [[TESLA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10586)] [[DC-BENCH](https://dc-bench.github.io/)] [[FedDM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09653)]
- **AutoML (NAS, OS, HPO)** <br/>
e.g. [[DARTS-PT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.04392)] [[DrNAS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10355)] [[GM-NAS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15207)] [[ENOS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13575)]


## Outreach
- **[ARC Group]** The ARC group - AIGC Research Collaboration - is a collective of multiple laboratories dedicated to exploring key areas in foundation models (LLMs, MLLMs, Diffusion Models, etc.). The team aims at pushing the boundary of SOTA academic research, and eventually translating the results into commercial applications. **Since established in Aug 2023, we have expanded to 9 researchers. We have achieved a project success rate of 100%, with 3 papers under review and 2 projects in wrapup stage.**. For more information on our culture and how to apply, please refer to [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PtRwK6KuqNhExz_ouiu1UDva5Fw6R7PuvrxsVCzSA9U/edit?usp=sharing).

- **[VC/Startups]** I've been interviewing for VC positions. If you are in VC/Startup business and for any reason is looking for people with domain knowledge in A.I., I'd be delighted to have a chat with you.


## Highlighted News
- **[Dec. 2023]** Together with multiple reowned researchers across academia and industry, I will be co-hosting the [1st workshop on Dataset Distillation]() [@CVPR 2024](https://cvpr.thecvf.com/). Please stay tuned for more details on submissions, speakers and events!
- **[Oct. 2023]** I will return to Google Research (Ads ML) for another internship hosted by Prof. [Inderjit S. Dhillon](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xBv5ZfkAAAAJ&hl=en), [Felix Yu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lYvF6cUAAAAJ&hl=en), and [Si Si](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eAJfUeIAAAAJ&hl=en), focusing on advancing the state of Large Language Models.

## Something personal
In my leisure time, I enjoy reading books and learning about swordsmanship.
I am student of Tenshin Shōden Katori Shintō-ryū (天真正傳香取神道流), with a lineage from the main branch founded by Otake Shihan (大竹利典師範).
