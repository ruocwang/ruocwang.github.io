## About Me
I am the founder and current principal of TurningPoint AI Research focus on multimodal agents (no we are not yet a startup) and a final-year Ph.D. at UCLA with Prof. [Cho-Jui Hsieh](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Wy89g4IAAAAJ&hl=en). I am also a long-term Student Researcher at Google working with Prof. [Inderjit S. Dhillon](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xBv5ZfkAAAAJ&hl=en), [Felix Yu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lYvF6cUAAAAJ&hl=en), [Boqing Gong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lv9ZeVUAAAAJ&hl=en), and [Ting Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4wSfAIQAAAAJ&hl=en).

I was the 1st-author recepient of the **[Outstanding Paper Award](https://iclr-conf.medium.com/announcing-iclr-2021-outstanding-paper-awards-9ae0514734ab)** at ICLR.
I received my B.S. in Computer Science and Statistics at the University of Michigan, with the highest distinction.

I am interested in Venture Capitalism.

<!-- During this period, I interned at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/) and [Sensetime](https://www.sensetime.com/en) on machine learning and computer vision, as well as helped a startup to develop its prototype robots. -->
<!-- 4Prior to that, I worked on quantitative investing at Shanghai Key Laboratory of Finance. -->


## Research Background (selected)
My goal is to build highly automatized, reliable and self-evolving multimodal language agents. Some technologies I worked on include:
- LLM-era: Instruction finetuning and prompt optimization of (M)LLMs, controllable generation and alignment of Diffusion models, MLLM safety, reasoning and agent finetuning.
- Pre-LLM-era: Efficient and automated ML, including AutoML and Dataset Compression.


## Awards (selected)
- Outstanding Paper Award, ICLR 2021, 04/2021.
- Outstanding Graduate Student (Master’s degree, 1 per department), UCLA CS Department, 05/2022.
- Award of Excellence, Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA), 09/2019.
- Highest Distinction Graduate Award, The University of Michigan, 08/2019.

## Outreach
- **[TurningPoint AI]** TPAI is a multi-lab research collaboration dedicated to exploring key technologies in building reliable multimodal foundational agents (involving MLLMs and Diffusion Models). We are a compact but hardcore team aims at pushing the boundary of state-of-the-art academic research, and eventually commercialize the results. For more information, please visit our website [here](https://turningpointai.wixsite.com/home).

- **[Work]** I am open to industrial opportunities (Corporate Research Team, VC, Startup) focus on building and commericializing next generation AIGC technologies. If you are in VC/Startup business or leading a corporate research team, I'd be delighted to have a chat with you.

## Something personal
Currently, my interests are centered around a diverse reading habit and practicing swordsmanship. I am a student of Katori Shintō-Ryū (天真正伝香取神道流), the ealiest comprehensive Japanese martial art system that has been passed down by 23 Shihans（师范）since 600 year ago.
